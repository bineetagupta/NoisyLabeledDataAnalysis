with noisy labels. In Advances in neural information processing systems, pages 1196-1204, 2013.]

--> Read and understand the paper. Explain the main ideas of the paper in your own words. </br>
--> Create at least one set of synthetic dataset, split it into training and testing parts, and add some label noise to the training set.</br>
--> Pick a classification method with lost function that satisfied the conditions mentioned in paper and build the unbiased estimator of the original loss function (see Lemma 1).</br>
--> Train your classifier on the synthetic noisy dataset (dataset (1)), and generate prediction results on dataset (2).</br>
--> Analyze your results (i:e: by using figures, error rates, etc).</br>

## Steps
### 1) Understanding the problem statement

### 2) Creating the synthetic data

### 3) Splitting the dataset into training set and testing set

### 4) Classification with a custom loss function

### 5) Analysis of result
